# Weedeater vs. the Mune
 A super super early WIP for a game I'm working on! Come back later for more details!

## New Stuff!
First time working with Gamemaker, GML, drawing sprite sheets, and just making a orginal RPG!

## Why was this Developed?
I've always wanted to make a game, especially a 2D one, and just got started. I searched up a good starter game engine and just went for it!

# Note:
  - 100% me vs. Gamemaker + art here
  - I have plans for this one, so look forward to it!
